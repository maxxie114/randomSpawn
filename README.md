# randomSpawn
This is a nukkit plugin I made that set random spawnpoint to players everytime they respawn, instead of just spawning at one spot, unless they already have spawnpoint at a bed.

This is my first ever nukkit plugin, but all known bugs are fixed.

- Plugin has been uploaded to nukkitx.com and nukkit.ru
