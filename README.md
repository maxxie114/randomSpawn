# randomSpawn
This is a nukkit plugin I made that set random spawnpoint to players everytime they join or died, instead of just spawning at one spot.


# Changelog
- Changed the method to teleport and get the highest point of a coordinate 
- Changed the method to prevent existing players being teleported away from where they were 
- Added another file
- Added a way to track down old players and new players
- Fixed error: Unable to change the hashSet stored in playerList.yml
- Prevented the bug where sometimes the plugin drop player from skyhigh and killed them
- Updated API to 1.0.7
- Updated Version to 3.0.0

# TODO
- Add support to avoid players from spawning on lava.
- Fix error: Unable to random teleport players on first join

# Attention
randomSpawn 3.0.0 is in beta, there won't be a release just yet
