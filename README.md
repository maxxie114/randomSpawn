# randomSpawn
This is a nukkit plugin I made that set random spawnpoint to players everytime they join or died, instead of just spawning at one spot.


# Changelog

- Changed the method to prevent existing players being teleported away from where they were
- Added another file
- Added a way to track down old players and new players
- Added teleport new Players on join
- Updated API to 1.0.7

# TODO
- Fix error: Unable to change the hashSet stored in playerList.yml
